  <h2>Fidelis Utility</h2>
  <h4>Deliverables:</h4>Low resolution designs, copy<br>
  <h4>Timeline:</h4>2019 - present
  <p>Aspen Fidelis Reliability is a tool for simulating conditions in a plant. When I was brought on as the designer for Fidelis, part of my work included coming up with designs for two tools- the Case Runner tool, and the Case Comparison tool.
  </p>
  <p>The Case Runner tool helps users to scale up their simulations quickly. In Fidelis, each simulation run is referred to as a "Lifecycle"; the Case Runner was designed to allow users to run multiple lifecycles on multiple copies of Fidelis (instances) and multiple threads. Though initially users were required to combine the resultant files manually, the files are now combined automatically at the end of the process.</p>
  <p>The Case Comparison tool, on the other hand, is useful when users want to compare results from different files. At the beginning of the project, the project manager sent me tables and charts that users would want to be able to compare results for. My initial design of a large tree grid was functional, if bland, but I wasn't happy with how much digging users would have to do to get valuable data. I briefly attempted a more visual box-and-whisker plot design before finally asking the correct question- what were users looking for when they compared the data? A variety of reasons, as it turned out. These reasons are reflected in the final design.

  <h2>Pando</h2>
  <h4>Deliverables:</h4>High resolution designs, icons, specifications, copy<br>
  <h4>Timeline:</h4>2017 - 2019
  <p>Over the course of my Master's degree, one project I had always wanted to work on was an asset management system- a place where designers could upload icons and images in order to easily share and retrieve them. In my Capstone project, I worked to make it a reality. I researched existing products, drafted personas, made and tested designs, and eventually programmed it in Go. The application never quite made it to a completed stage, but may eventually.</p>

  <h2>Mtell Health Investigation Report</h2>
  <h4>Deliverables:</h4>Low resolution designs, high resolution designs, copy<br>
  <h4>Timeline:</h4>2017
  <p>Aspen Mtell is an application that allows users to predict whether their equipment will fail in various ways. When a piece of equipment seems likely to fail, the system alerts the user who will then investigate the piece of equipment to see what is wrong and what needs to be done. The Health Investigation Report tool was designed to assist users in putting together a report on these alerts. Though initial requirements called for fully customizable and reusable layouts, the scope was eventually simplified.</p>

  <h2>Exchange</h2>
  <h4>Deliverables:</h4>HTML/JS/Jquery Prototype<br>
  <h4>Timeline:</h4>2016
  <p>When our product line's resource site was redesigned, I was called in to try and demonstrate some slick animations that could improve the site's curb appeal. Working with my manager at the time, we decided on what interactions should be animated and then I set out making it a reality. With this prototype we were able to determine some flaws with the initial design- it's a bit weird to have all of the search results light up when you move your cursor quickly, so we determined that the final product would have a delay baked in. Almost all of the items in the viewing pane are clickable, so try it out!

  <h2>Aspen Basic Engineering (ABE)</h2>
  <h4>Deliverables:</h4>Low resolution designs, high resolution designs, icons, specifications, copy, user testing<br>
  <h4>Timeline:</h4>2015 - present
  <p>Aspen Basic Engineering is a tool that allows users to create documents about equipment. These records can be used as references or as specification documents for new pieces of equipment. In this project, I was tasked with redesigning the ABE interface as a web application. Undoubtedly my largest project ever, the design and development work for the redesign took nearly two years as we hashed out requirements, made mockups, and made changes. Since the redesign's release, I have continued to work with the team on refining the product.</p>

    <h2>aspenONE Drive</h2>
    <h4>Deliverables:</h4>High resolution designs, icons, specifications, copy<br>
    <h4>Timeline:</h4>2014
    <p>For this project, I was asked to design an interface that would allow users to upload their desktop application files to the internet for use with aspenONE, an application with a similar function to Microsoft's OneDrive.
    </p>
    <p>The design was done using (what were) standard Microsoft design styles and AspenTech styles.
